Problem Statement for Mocking example

Problem Statement

You’ve already implemented a stub (StubTopicProvider) that returns canned topics for testing TopicManager.
Now, extend your learning by creating a mock version of the provider.

Tasks

Create MockTopicProvider

Implement the same interface (TopicProvider).

Add fields to record:

Whether the method was called (called bool).

How many times it was called (calledCount int).

Any data passed back or captured.

Update Test

Replace the stub with the mock in your test.

Verify:

The provider method was called.

It was called exactly once.

The result matches expectations.

Compare Results

Run the same test using both stub and mock.

Discuss the difference in purpose:

Stub → "data only"

Mock → "interaction + data"
