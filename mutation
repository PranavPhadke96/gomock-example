1. Install go-mutesting

go install github.com/avito-tech/go-mutesting/cmd/go-mutesting@latest 

2. Verify go-mutesting is installed
go-mutesting --help

In case the above command does not work,
Check If you already have Git for Windows installed on your system 

Check the below path:

C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\diff.exe


Add that folder to your PATH (same way we added %USERPROFILE%\go\bin earlier).

Restart VS Code.

Run the command again -
go-mutesting --help

3. Run mutation testing
go-mutesting ./...
