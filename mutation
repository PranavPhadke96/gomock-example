1. Install go-mutesting

go install github.com/avito-tech/go-mutesting/cmd/go-mutesting@latest 

2. Verify go-mutesting is installed
go-mutesting --help

If above is not working, 
Option A (quick fix): install GNU diffutils for Windows

Download from GnuWin32 diffutils
 or Git for Windows (includes diff)
.

Make sure diff.exe is in your PATH.

If you have Git for Windows installed, check:

C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\diff.exe


Add that folder to your PATH (same way we added %USERPROFILE%\go\bin earlier).

Restart VS Code.

Run again:

3. Run mutation testing
go-mutesting ./...


Alternative tool : Gremlins
1. Install 
go install github.com/go-gremlins/gremlins/cmd/gremlins@latest
2. Run
gremlins unleash
