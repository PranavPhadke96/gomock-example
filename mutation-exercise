Problem Statement
Business Goal
We need a function to calculate late payment fees for invoices. The company charges a penalty when customers pay after the due date. The penalty must be predictable, capped, and fair.

Requirements
Input:

Invoice amount (integer, pounds).

Invoice due date (time.Time).

Payment date (time.Time).

Output:

Late fee (integer, pounds).

Rules for calculation

Daily fee: Â£2 per calendar day late.

Cap: The late fee cannot exceed 10% of the invoice amount (rounded down).

No fee cases:

If the invoice amount is zero or negative.

If the payment is made on or before the due date.

Date handling: Compare only calendar days (ignore time of day).
